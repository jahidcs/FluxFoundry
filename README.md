# FluxFoundry
My DevOps Journey

Here's a breakdown of the terms FluxFoundry:

Flux: In metallurgy, flux is a material that helps remove impurities and improve the flow of molten metal. In DevOps, "flux" could metaphorically represent the automation and streamlining  of processes, removing bottlenecks and inefficiencies.

Foundry: A foundry is a place where metal is cast into shapes. In DevOps, it could represent the building and shaping of infrastructure and applications.

So, "Flux Foundry" could be interpreted as:

A place where DevOps tools and processes are created to improve development workflows.
A repository focused on automating and streamlining deployments.
